We did Revision of All we've learnt till date

<!--Arrow Function for a single line-->
let myFunction = () =>

<!--Arrow Function for a multi-line-->
let myFunction = () => {

}

 We call property and method, 
 <!--with and  without () --> respectively

 <!-- SUPER -->
Super is a keyword used to make constructor accesible to other class from the parent class

<!-- GETTER -->
Get is a keyword in javascript whose job is to bind an object property to a function  when that function is accessed

get is a keyword not method 

get helps in data security

Finally we were given a class work to be done
